This is a little APN (augmented proportional navigation) missile-guidance simulator. I have been curious about how the guidance for things like the AIM-120 AMRAAM work for a while, found some online articles talking about it, decided to implement it at 2 am. There are still some bugs in it right now, and it's more of a small side project since it's near the end of the semester, but hopefully this will help someone who's curious about missile guidance understand it a little better!
